# Computer Controller

## TODO
1. Fix issues with memory leaks sending screen image from client to server
2. Use different threads for sending/receiving inputs and screenshots
    + Currently displaying the screenshots with the inputs slows down the inputs b/c they have to wait up for the screenshots
